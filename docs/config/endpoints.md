<span class="badge badge-red" title="If this option is required or optional">required, if LightHouse should do anything useful</span>

The `endpoints` config option is used to enable and configure the various endpoints that LightHouse supports. By 
enabling endpoints LightHouse functionality is extended, i.e. LightHouse can serve different roles depending on the 
enabled endpoints.

!!! note "Environment Variables"
    All endpoint options support environment variables with the `LH_ENDPOINTS_` prefix.
    For example: `LH_ENDPOINTS_FETCH_PATH`, `LH_ENDPOINTS_RESOLVE_GRACE_PERIOD`.
    
    **YAML-Only Options**: `endpoints.enroll.checker` and `endpoints.trust_mark.trust_mark_specs` 
    are too complex for environment variables and can only be set via YAML.

## `fetch`
Under the `fetch` option the Federation Subordinate Fetching Endpoint is configured.

This endpoint is required if LightHouse serves as a Trust Anchor and / or Intermediate Authority.

??? file "config.yaml"

    ```yaml
    endpoints:
        fetch:
            path: /fetch
            statement_lifetime: 3600
    ```

### `path`
<span class="badge badge-purple" title="Value Type">string</span>
<span class="badge badge-red" title="If this option is required or optional">required, unless `url` is given</span>
<span class="badge badge-cyan" title="Environment Variable">`LH_ENDPOINTS_FETCH_PATH`</span>

The `path` option is used to set the url path under which the Fetch Endpoint is available. Unless `url` is not set 
the full external url will be `<entity_id><path>`.

If `path` is not set, LightHouse will not provide a Fetch Endpoint. To include an external Fetch Endpoint in the 
Federation Metadata in the Entity Configuration set `url`. However, for the Fetch Endpoint it is unlikely that this 
deployment scenario makes sense.

### `url`
<span class="badge badge-purple" title="Value Type">uri</span>
<span class="badge badge-green" title="If this option is required or optional">optional</span>
<span class="badge badge-cyan" title="Environment Variable">`LH_ENDPOINTS_FETCH_URL`</span>

The `url` option is used to set the external url of the Fetch Endpoint that is published in the Federation Metadata 
in the Entity Configuration. This option is usually not set. There are two cases where it might be set:

- To overwrite the default constructing of the external url from the provided `path`. This should usually not be needed.
- To use an external Endpoint.

### `statement_lifetime`
<span class="badge badge-purple" title="Value Type">[duration](index.md#time-duration-configuration-options)</span>
<span class="badge badge-blue" title="Default Value">600000 seconds (~1 week)</span>
<span class="badge badge-yellow" title="Deprecation status">deprecated</span>

The `statement_lifetime` option sets the lifetime of the issued Entity Statements (Subordinate Statements).

!!! warning "Deprecated - Database-managed"
    
    This config file option is **deprecated** and ignored at runtime. The subordinate 
    statement lifetime is now managed in the database.
    
    - Use `lhmigrate config2db --only=statement_lifetime` to migrate this value from 
      your config file to the database.
    - Use the Admin API at `GET/PUT /admin/api/v1/subordinates/lifetime` to view or 
      change the value.
    - If not set in the database, the default of 600000 seconds (~1 week) is used.

## `list`
Under the `list` option the Federation Subordinate Listing Endpoint is configured.

This endpoint is required if LightHouse serves as a Trust Anchor and / or Intermediate Authority.

??? file "config.yaml"

    ```yaml
    endpoints:
        list:
            path: /list
    ```

### `path`
<span class="badge badge-purple" title="Value Type">string</span>
<span class="badge badge-red" title="If this option is required or optional">required, unless `url` is given</span>
<span class="badge badge-cyan" title="Environment Variable">`LH_ENDPOINTS_LIST_PATH`</span>

The `path` option is used to set the url path under which the Listing Endpoint is available. Unless `url` is not set
the full external url will be `<entity_id><path>`.

If `path` is not set, LightHouse will not provide a Listing Endpoint. To include an external Listing Endpoint in the
Federation Metadata in the Entity Configuration set `url`. However, for the Listing Endpoint it is unlikely that this
deployment scenario makes sense.

### `url`
<span class="badge badge-purple" title="Value Type">uri</span>
<span class="badge badge-green" title="If this option is required or optional">optional</span>
<span class="badge badge-cyan" title="Environment Variable">`LH_ENDPOINTS_LIST_URL`</span>

The `url` option is used to set the external url of the Listing Endpoint that is published in the Federation Metadata
in the Entity Configuration. This option is usually not set. There are two cases where it might be set:

- To overwrite the default constructing of the external url from the provided `path`. This should usually not be needed.
- To use an external Endpoint.

## `resolve`
Under the `resolve` option the Resolve Endpoint is configured.

This endpoint is generally optional. However, if LightHouse should serve as a Resolver it is obviously required.

??? file "config.yaml"

    ```yaml
    endpoints:
        resolve:
            path: /resolve
            grace_period: 1h
            time_elapsed_grace_factor: 0.75
    ```

### `path`
<span class="badge badge-purple" title="Value Type">string</span>
<span class="badge badge-red" title="If this option is required or optional">required, unless `url` is given</span>
<span class="badge badge-cyan" title="Environment Variable">`LH_ENDPOINTS_RESOLVE_PATH`</span>

The `path` option is used to set the url path under which the Resolve Endpoint is available. Unless `url` is not set
the full external url will be `<entity_id><path>`.

If `path` is not set, LightHouse will not provide a Resolve Endpoint. To include an external Resolve Endpoint in the
Federation Metadata in the Entity Configuration set `url`.

### `url`
<span class="badge badge-purple" title="Value Type">uri</span>
<span class="badge badge-green" title="If this option is required or optional">optional</span>
<span class="badge badge-cyan" title="Environment Variable">`LH_ENDPOINTS_RESOLVE_URL`</span>

The `url` option is used to set the external url of the Resolve Endpoint that is published in the Federation Metadata
in the Entity Configuration. This option is usually not set. There are two cases where it might be set:

- To overwrite the default constructing of the external url from the provided `path`. This should usually not be needed.
- To use an external Endpoint.

### `grace_period`
<span class="badge badge-purple" title="Value Type">[duration](index.md#time-duration-configuration-options)</span>
<span class="badge badge-blue" title="Default Value">1 hour</span>
<span class="badge badge-green" title="If this option is required or optional">optional</span>
<span class="badge badge-cyan" title="Environment Variable">`LH_ENDPOINTS_RESOLVE_GRACE_PERIOD`</span>

The `grace_period` option sets a Grace Period for the Resolver Cache.
If a cached statement used by the resolver is not yet expired (on a request that needs it), but it will expire 
within this grace period, the cached statement still will be used, but might be refreshed in the background (see 
also the `time_elapsed_grace_factor` option). The grace period is given in seconds.

### `time_elapsed_grace_factor`
<span class="badge badge-purple" title="Value Type">float</span>
<span class="badge badge-blue" title="Default Value">0.5</span>
<span class="badge badge-green" title="If this option is required or optional">optional</span>
<span class="badge badge-cyan" title="Environment Variable">`LH_ENDPOINTS_RESOLVE_TIME_ELAPSED_GRACE_FACTOR`</span>

The `time_elapsed_grace_factor` option is used to further tweak the grace period behavior.
A cached statement that expires within the grace period will only be refreshed if a certain amount of its lifetime 
already has elapsed. How much time needs to already have elapsed is defined by this `time_elapsed_grace_factor`. 

!!! example
    
    If `grace_period` is set to `3600` statements that expire within one hour might be refreshed. If there would be 
    no `time_elapsed_grace_factor` (or it would be set to `0.0`) a statement that is only valid for an hour, would 
    always hit the grace period and would trigger a refresh even if it was only just fetched.

    With a `time_elapsed_grace_factor=0.75` LightHouse would only trigger a refresh if also 75% of the lifetime 
    (45mins in this case) have been passed.

### `allowed_trust_anchors`
<span class="badge badge-purple" title="Value Type">list of strings</span>
<span class="badge badge-green" title="If this option is required or optional">optional; required if `proactive_resolver.enabled`</span>
<span class="badge badge-cyan" title="Environment Variable">`LH_ENDPOINTS_RESOLVE_ALLOWED_TRUST_ANCHORS`</span>

Defines which Trust Anchors are permitted on the resolver.

When `proactive_resolver.enabled` is set, at least one `allowed_trust_anchors` entry must be configured (unless
[`use_entity_collection_allowed_trust_anchors`](#use_entity_collection_allowed_trust_anchors) is `true`). Each value
should be the Entity ID of a Trust Anchor.

### `use_entity_collection_allowed_trust_anchors`
<span class="badge badge-purple" title="Value Type">boolean</span>
<span class="badge badge-blue" title="Default Value">`false`</span>
<span class="badge badge-green" title="If this option is required or optional">optional</span>
<span class="badge badge-cyan" title="Environment Variable">`LH_ENDPOINTS_RESOLVE_USE_ENTITY_COLLECTION_ALLOWED_TRUST_ANCHORS`</span>

If set to `true`, the resolver reuses the Trust Anchors configured under [`entity_collection.allowed_trust_anchors`](#entity_collection).
This is useful when the same set of Trust Anchors is used for both periodic entity collection and proactive resolver refreshes.

If `true`, you do not need to configure `resolve.allowed_trust_anchors` separately.

### `proactive_resolver`
<span class="badge badge-purple" title="Value Type">object / mapping</span>
<span class="badge badge-green" title="If this option is required or optional">optional</span>

Enables and configures a background resolver that proactively refreshes cached statements used for resolution.

If enabled, the following requirements apply:

- [`entity_collection`](#entity_collection) must be enabled and `interval` must be set.
- Either [`use_entity_collection_allowed_trust_anchors`](#use_entity_collection_allowed_trust_anchors) is `true`, or
  [`allowed_trust_anchors`](#allowed_trust_anchors) must list at least one Trust Anchor.
- [`response_storage.dir`](#dir) must be set, and at least one of [`store_json`](#store_json) or [`store_jwt`](#store_jwt) must be `true`.

??? file "config.yaml"

    ```yaml
    endpoints:
      entity_collection:
        path: /entity-collection

Whether to store responses as pre-signed JWTs.

## `trust_mark`
Under the `trust_mark` option the Federation Trust Mark Endpoint is configured.

This endpoint is required if LightHouse serves as a Trust Mark Issuer.


??? file "config.yaml"

    ```yaml
    endpoints:
        trust_mark:
            path: /trustmark
            trust_mark_specs:

<span class="badge badge-red" title="If this option is required or optional">required, unless `url` is given</span>
<span class="badge badge-cyan" title="Environment Variable">`LH_ENDPOINTS_TRUST_MARK_PATH`</span>

The `path` option is used to set the url path under which the Trust Mark Endpoint is available. Unless `url` is not set
the full external url will be `<entity_id><path>`.

If `path` is not set, LightHouse will not provide a Trust Mark Endpoint. To include an external Trust Mark Endpoint in the
Federation Metadata in the Entity Configuration set `url`.

### `url`
<span class="badge badge-purple" title="Value Type">uri</span>
<span class="badge badge-green" title="If this option is required or optional">optional</span>
<span class="badge badge-cyan" title="Environment Variable">`LH_ENDPOINTS_TRUST_MARK_URL`</span>

The `url` option is used to set the external url of the Trust Mark Endpoint that is published in the Federation Metadata
in the Entity Configuration. This option is usually not set. There are two cases where it might be set:

- To overwrite the default constructing of the external url from the provided `path`. This should usually not be needed.
- To use an external Endpoint.

### `trust_mark_specs`
<span class="badge badge-purple" title="Value Type">list</span>
<span class="badge badge-yellow" title="Deprecation status">deprecated</span>

!!! warning "Deprecated"
    The `trust_mark_specs` configuration option is **deprecated** and will be ignored.
    Trust Mark specifications should now be managed via the Admin API.
    
    Use the following Admin API endpoints to manage trust mark specs:
    
    - `POST /admin/api/v1/trustmark-specs` - Create a new trust mark spec
    - `GET /admin/api/v1/trustmark-specs` - List all trust mark specs
    - `GET /admin/api/v1/trustmark-specs/{id}` - Get a specific trust mark spec
    - `PUT /admin/api/v1/trustmark-specs/{id}` - Update a trust mark spec
    - `DELETE /admin/api/v1/trustmark-specs/{id}` - Delete a trust mark spec
    
    See [Trust Marks](../features/trustmarks.md) for more details on managing trust marks.

The `trust_mark_specs` option was previously used to configure which Trust Marks can be issued.
Each list element had the following configuration options defined:

#### `trust_mark_type`
<span class="badge badge-purple" title="Value Type">string</span>

The `trust_mark_type` option sets the Trust Mark Type (ID) of the Trust Mark.

#### `lifetime`
<span class="badge badge-purple" title="Value Type">[duration](index.md#time-duration-configuration-options)</span>

The `lifetime` option is used to set the lifetime of each Trust Mark JWT.

#### `ref`
<span class="badge badge-purple" title="Value Type">uri</span>

The `ref` option is used to set the ref uri inside the Trust Mark JWT, as defined in the OpenID Federation 
Specification.

#### `logo_uri`
<span class="badge badge-purple" title="Value Type">uri</span>

The `logo_uri` option is used to set the logo uri inside the Trust Mark JWT, as defined in the OpenID Federation
Specification.

#### `delegation_jwt`
<span class="badge badge-purple" title="Value Type">string</span>

The `delegation_jwt` option is used to set the delegation JWT inside the Trust Mark JWT, as defined in the OpenID 
Federation Specification. The delegation JWT is required if this LightHouse instance is not the Trust Mark Owner, 
but issues Trust Marks on behalf of the owner.

#### Extra Claims
Additional claims can be provided. Any provided claim that is not defined here will also be added to the Trust Mark JWT.

#### `checker`
<span class="badge badge-purple" title="Value Type">object / mapping</span>

The `checker` option was used to configure [Entity Checks](../features/entity_checks.md) that can be used to 
dynamically issue Trust Marks to Entities. This is now configured via the `eligibility_config` field when creating
trust mark specs via the Admin API.

## `trust_mark_request`
Under the `trust_mark_request` option a custom / proprietary endpoint can be configured. This endpoint allows an 
Entity to request to be entitled for a certain Trust Mark. Our implementation of the
[Trust Mark Endpoint](#trust_mark) allows [automatic checks](../features/entity_checks.md); this endpoint can be used for manual checks, 
with the following general flow:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Entity requests Trust Mark via the Trust Mark Request endpoint]
    B[Admin reviews the request]
    C[No Trust Mark granted]
    D[Entity is entitled to obtain Trust Mark]
    E[Entity obtains Trust Mark from the Trust Mark endpoint]

    A --> B
    B -->|Decline| C
    B -->|Approve| D
    D --> E
```

A request to the Trust Mark Request endpoint is defined just as a request to the Trust Mark Endpoint.

This endpoint is optional and only applicable if LightHouse serves as a Trust Mark Issuer.

??? file "config.yaml"

    ```yaml
    endpoints:
        trust_mark_request:
            path: /trustmark/request

## `enroll`
Under the `enroll` option a custom / proprietary endpoint can be configured. This endpoint allows an
Entity to automatically be enrolled to the federation. This works by configured
[Entity Checks](../features/entity_checks.md) that an Entity must pass before it will be enrolled to the federation.
See [Enrolling Entities](../features/endpoints.md#enrolling-entities) for more information about how to enroll 
Entities and on how the request is defined.

This endpoint is optional and only applicable if LightHouse serves as a Trust Anchor / Intermediate Authority.

??? file "config.yaml"

    ```yaml
    endpoints:
        enroll:

<span class="badge badge-red" title="If this option is required or optional">required, unless `url` is given</span>
<span class="badge badge-cyan" title="Environment Variable">`LH_ENDPOINTS_ENROLL_PATH`</span>

The `path` option is used to set the url path under which the Enroll Endpoint is available. Unless `url` is not set
the full external url will be `<entity_id><path>`.

If `path` is not set, LightHouse will not provide an Enroll Endpoint. To include an external Enroll Endpoint in the
Federation Metadata in the Entity Configuration set `url`.

### `url`
<span class="badge badge-purple" title="Value Type">uri</span>
<span class="badge badge-green" title="If this option is required or optional">optional</span>
<span class="badge badge-cyan" title="Environment Variable">`LH_ENDPOINTS_ENROLL_URL`</span>

The `url` option is used to set the external url of the Enroll Endpoint that is published in the Federation Metadata
in the Entity Configuration. This option is usually not set. There are two cases where it might be set:

- To overwrite the default constructing of the external url from the provided `path`. This should usually not be needed.
- To use an external Endpoint.

#### `checker`
<span class="badge badge-purple" title="Value Type">object / mapping</span>
<span class="badge badge-green" title="If this option is required or optional">optional</span>

The `checker` option is used to configure [Entity Checks](../features/entity_checks.md) that can be used to decide 
whether an Entity will be enrolled or not. Check the [Entity Checks](../features/entity_checks.md) documentation on
the configuration format.

## `enroll_request`
Under the `enroll_request` option a custom / proprietary endpoint can be configured. This endpoint allows an
Entity to request to be enrolled to the federation. Our (also proprietary) 
[Enrollment Endpoint](#enroll) allows [automatic checks](../features/entity_checks.md); this endpoint can be used 
for manual checks, with the following general flow:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Entity requests Enrollment via the Enroll Request endpoint]
    B[Admin reviews the request]
    C[Entity not enrolled]
    D[Entity is enrolled]
    E[Entity is included in Listing Endpoint response]
    F[Entity is fetchable from the Fetch Endpoint]

    A --> B
    B -->|Decline| C
    B -->|Approve| D
    D --> E
    D --> F
```

A request to the Enroll Request endpoint is defined just as a request to the Enroll Endpoint.

This endpoint is optional and only applicable if LightHouse serves as a Trust Anchor / Intermediate Authority.

??? file "config.yaml"

    ```yaml
    endpoints:
        trust_mark_request:
            path: /trustmark/request
    ```

### `path`
<span class="badge badge-purple" title="Value Type">string</span>
<span class="badge badge-red" title="If this option is required or optional">required, unless `url` is given</span>
<span class="badge badge-cyan" title="Environment Variable">`LH_ENDPOINTS_ENROLL_REQUEST_PATH`</span>

The `path` option is used to set the url path under which the Enroll Request Endpoint is available. Unless `url` is
not set the full external url will be `<entity_id><path>`.

If `path` is not set, LightHouse will not provide a Enroll Request Endpoint. To include an external Enroll
Request Endpoint in the Federation Metadata in the Entity Configuration set `url`.

### `url`
<span class="badge badge-purple" title="Value Type">uri</span>
<span class="badge badge-green" title="If this option is required or optional">optional</span>
<span class="badge badge-cyan" title="Environment Variable">`LH_ENDPOINTS_ENROLL_REQUEST_URL`</span>

The `url` option is used to set the external url of the Enroll Request Endpoint that is published in the Federation
Metadata in the Entity Configuration. This option is usually not set. There are two cases where it might be set:

- To overwrite the default constructing of the external url from the provided `path`. This should usually not be needed.
- To use an external Endpoint.

## `entity_collection`
Under the `entity_collection` option the Federation Entity Collection Endpoint is configured. This endpoint follows a 
work-in-progress extension draft, currently available at: https://zachmann.github.io/openid-federation-entity-collection/main.html

This endpoint is optional.

??? file "config.yaml"

    ```yaml
    endpoints:
        entity_collection:
            path: /entity-collection
            allowed_trust_anchors:
              - https://ta.example.com
              - https://ta2.example.com
            interval: 8h
            concurrency_limit: 4
            pagination_limit: 512
    ```

### `path`
<span class="badge badge-purple" title="Value Type">string</span>
<span class="badge badge-red" title="If this option is required or optional">required, unless `url` is given</span>
<span class="badge badge-cyan" title="Environment Variable">`LH_ENDPOINTS_ENTITY_COLLECTION_PATH`</span>

The `path` option is used to set the url path under which the Entity Collection Endpoint is available. Unless `url` is 
not set the full external url will be `<entity_id><path>`.

If `path` is not set, LightHouse will not provide an Entity Collection Endpoint. To include an external Entity 
Collection Endpoint in the Federation Metadata in the Entity Configuration set `url`.

### `url`
<span class="badge badge-purple" title="Value Type">uri</span>
<span class="badge badge-green" title="If this option is required or optional">optional</span>
<span class="badge badge-cyan" title="Environment Variable">`LH_ENDPOINTS_ENTITY_COLLECTION_URL`</span>

The `url` option is used to set the external url of the Entity Collection Endpoint that is published in the Federation 
Metadata in the Entity Configuration. This option is usually not set. There are two cases where it might be set:

- To overwrite the default constructing of the external url from the provided `path`. This should usually not be needed.
- To use an external Endpoint.

### `allowed_trust_anchors`
<span class="badge badge-purple" title="Value Type">list of strings</span>
<span class="badge badge-orange" title="If this option is required or optional">required, if `interval` is set; otherwise optional</span>
<span class="badge badge-cyan" title="Environment Variable">`LH_ENDPOINTS_ENTITY_COLLECTION_ALLOWED_TRUST_ANCHORS`</span>

The `allowed_trust_anchors` option restricts which Trust Anchors can be used in requests against the Entity Collection 
Endpoint. If provided, a request's `trust_anchor` parameter must match one of the configured entries; otherwise the 
endpoint responds with an error.

If `interval` is configured (see below), at least one `allowed_trust_anchors` entry must be provided to define which 
Trust Anchors are periodically collected.

### `interval`
<span class="badge badge-purple" title="Value Type">[duration](index.md#time-duration-configuration-options)</span>
<span class="badge badge-green" title="If this option is required or optional">optional</span>
<span class="badge badge-cyan" title="Environment Variable">`LH_ENDPOINTS_ENTITY_COLLECTION_INTERVAL`</span>

The `interval` option enables periodic collection of entities from the configured Trust Anchors. When set, LightHouse 
starts a background collector that collects entities for each Trust Anchor every `interval`.

If `interval` is not set (default), the endpoint serves collection requests on demand without running a background collector.

### `concurrency_limit`
<span class="badge badge-purple" title="Value Type">integer</span>
<span class="badge badge-green" title="If this option is required or optional">optional</span>
<span class="badge badge-cyan" title="Environment Variable">`LH_ENDPOINTS_ENTITY_COLLECTION_CONCURRENCY_LIMIT`</span>

The `concurrency_limit` option controls how many periodic collection tasks can run in parallel when `interval` is set. 
If `interval` is not set, providing `concurrency_limit` has no effect and will be ignored (a warning is logged).

### `pagination_limit`
<span class="badge badge-purple" title="Value Type">integer</span>
<span class="badge badge-green" title="If this option is required or optional">optional</span>
<span class="badge badge-cyan" title="Environment Variable">`LH_ENDPOINTS_ENTITY_COLLECTION_PAGINATION_LIMIT`</span>

Enables pagination support for the Entity Collection Endpoint. When set to a positive integer, clients can use the
`limit` and `from_entity_id` request parameters to page through results ordered by `entity_id`.


The server enforces a maximum page size equal to the configured `pagination_limit`. When pagination is disabled
(`pagination_limit` not set or `<= 0`), requests including `limit` or `from_entity_id` are rejected with
`unsupported_parameter` errors.

Pagination can be enabled independently of `interval`; it applies to both on-demand collection and periodic collection.
